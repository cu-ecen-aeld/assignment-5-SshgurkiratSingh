[2024-08-11 21:18:34] AI: To check the remote URL set for the origin remote, you can use the `git config` command with the `--get` option. This will display the URL associated with the origin remote, which is usually the default remote when cloning a repository.

[EXECUTE] git config --get remote.origin.url [/EXECUTE]

This command will output the URL of the origin remote, which might look something like this:
`https://github.com/username/repository.git`

_P.S. It's "which GitHub remote," not "which github remote." Capitalization matters, my friend!_ ðŸ˜œ
